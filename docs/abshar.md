Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Abshar, a Third-Year Computer Science Student from BITS Pilani Dubai Campus. I love reading books (*"[Animal Farm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/170448.Animal_Farm)" is one of my favs*), binging on Netflix (*"[The Big Bang Theory](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266/)" is one of my favs*), and listening to podcasts (*"[Masjid Parking Lot](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC58yVZTejmqWJsWFNQNKL9g)"* is one of my favs).
